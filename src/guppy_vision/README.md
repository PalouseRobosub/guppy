# guppy_vision

This package houses all of the main code to drive the vision system on Guppy.

## AprilTag Recognition

Before we train a YOLO model, we are using AprilTag detection instead of emoji glyphs. This allows us to test quickly without needing the full pipeline.

ALl the `apriltag` node does is publish four corners and fiducial ID, it does not perform any pose estimation itself.

## Webcam Publisher

This node simply publishes USB webcams as a ROS image topic. This is intended as a temporary measure until the Flir cameras are mounted externally, which have their own code.

## PnP Algorithm

This node uses a simple PnP approach to pose estimation from YOLO or AprilTag detections.

## Psuedo-SLAM Node

This node publishes tf2 transforms and analyzes the current images in sight. Combined with dead-reckoning odometry data from the DVL and IMU, it also generates a full global pose over time.
